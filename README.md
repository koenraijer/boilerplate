## To do
- On the project page: make info right column that is sticky, with most of the page being the images you can scroll through. 
- Make header get shadow when scrolling down but not when not scrolling or scrolling up. Use svelte-inview for this 
(https://github.com/maciekgrzybek/svelte-inview)

- Add click to copy
- Add figcaption

- Add subtle filter in theme color over hero image
- Revert body font to regular 'sans' stack, only Raleway for headers.
